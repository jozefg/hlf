## HLF

> I can therefore I should.

HLF is an implementation of LF ala [Twelf][twelf]. It is implemented
as a DSL within Haskell because I hate parsing. At the moment HLF
doesn't have poor error handling, it simply has no error handling.

HLF will simply accept or reject your program. It's your job to figure
out why. â™¥
