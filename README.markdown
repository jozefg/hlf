## HLF

HLF is an implementation of LF ala [Twelf][twelf]. It is implemented
as a DSL within Haskell because I hate parsing.

For some examples of how to actually use this look at
`examples/`. Notably this includes the code for the typing judgments
of simply typed lambda calculus and natural number examples.

HLF doesn't have the logic programming half of Twelf yet. This
probably won't happen until after my midterms are done and I can hack
on this guilt free.
